Project Based Virtual Internship as Data Scientist at Home Credit Indonesia

### Overview
PT Home Credit Indonesia is a technology-based financing company that has been in operation since 2013, with an extensive network of partner stores in over 200 cities across Indonesia. Home Credit continues to evolve into a trusted financial partner for millions of customers. Currently, we are designing statistical methods and machine learning techniques to generate credit score predictions. By doing so, we ensure that customers capable of making payments are not rejected when applying for loans. Loans can be granted with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar designed to motivate customers toward success.
1. <b>Problem:</b> 8% of the total 307,511 customers are experiencing loan defaults, posing a potential risk of financial loss.
2. <b>Goals:</b> Decrease the default rate among customers to minimize the potential risk of financial loss.
3. <b>Objective:</b> Develop a classification model to generate credit score predictions for binary values (0 indicating clients without payment difficulties and 1 indicating clients with payment difficulties), and selectively approve loans based on predictions of 0.
4. <b>Business Metrics:</b> Default rate.
